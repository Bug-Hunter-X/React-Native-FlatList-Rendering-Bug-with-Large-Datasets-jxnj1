# React Native FlatList Rendering Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug encountered when using FlatList in React Native with large datasets. The bug manifests as blank spaces or incorrect data being displayed in the list when scrolling quickly.

## Bug Description

The FlatList component fails to render items correctly under conditions of rapid scrolling, potentially due to inefficient rendering or key assignment. The provided code exhibits this issue.

## Solution

A solution to this bug is provided in `bugSolution.js`. The approach focuses on optimizing the rendering process and key extraction within the FlatList component.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the app on an emulator or physical device.
4. Scroll the list quickly.  Observe the intermittent rendering issues.

## Solution Overview

The solution involves optimizing the FlatList component's performance. This may include using the `keyExtractor` prop to uniquely identify each item. Consider other optimization techniques, as well, such as `windowSize` or `initialNumToRender` to limit the initial rendering.
