This bug occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native with a large dataset.  The issue is that when the user scrolls quickly, some items in the list might not render correctly, resulting in blank spaces or incorrect data being displayed. This is often due to improper optimization or improper key assignment in the FlatList component. 

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={this.state.data}
  renderItem={({item}) => <Text>{item.text}</Text>}
/>
```
